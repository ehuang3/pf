What is state space?
    The robot is a holonomic moving in 2D space.
    State is comprised of x, y and theta

What is action or control space?
    
    Action is the isplacement of robot in the robot frame

What is motion model?
    
    We need P(x_t | x_{t-1}, u_t)

    u_t is the action. How do we get this?


What is sensor model?

What is the measurement?
    
    We have measurements from odometer and laser.

    Laser : 180 values, each representing distance from obstacles, separated by 1 degree.

Map size is 8000 cms by 8000 cms as given in map file.
